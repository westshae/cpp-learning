# CPP-Learning
## Brief introduction
This project contains a few nice and short projects to understand certain parts of C++, as we are using the language at VUW.

Currently the mini projects include a hello-world, a "print what you input" project, a project centered around using vectors and the largest project, a fibonacci sequence calculator/printer which was also work on a small algorithm project.
